## Introduction

Snakes and Ladders is a simple board game where players move their pieces according to dice rolls, encountering snakes and ladders that either send them back or advance them on the board. This project aims to provide an engaging and interactive version of the game, developed with a focus on clean code, modularity, and agile principles.

## Features ðŸš€

- Classic Snakes and Ladders gameplay
- User-friendly interface
- Multiplayer support
- Configurable board size and snake/ladder positions
- Robust error handling
- Clean and maintainable code using MVC architecture

## Technologies

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **MVC Architecture**: Separates the application logic into Model, View, and Controller components for better modularity and maintainability.
- **Agile Methodology**: Development followed an iterative approach with regular updates and refinements.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snakes-and-ladders.git
    cd snakes-and-ladders
    ```

2. Compile the Java code:
    ```bash
    javac -d bin src/*.java
    ```

3. Run the game:
    ```bash
    java -cp bin Main
    ```

## Usage

1. Launch the game using the installation steps above.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to start a new game.
3. Roll the dice and move your piece according to the result.
4. Climb ladders and avoid snakes to reach the end of the board first!

## Development Methodology

### Agile Method

This project was developed using the Agile methodology, which involves iterative development, regular feedback, and continuous improvement. Key practices included:

- **Sprints**: Work was divided into short, manageable sprints, each focusing on specific features or improvements.
- **Daily Stand-ups**: Regular meetings were held to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.
- **Backlog Management**: Features and tasks were tracked in a backlog, with priorities adjusted based on feedback and progress.

### MVC Architecture 

The application is structured according to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern:

- **Model**: Represents the game data and business logic, including the board, players, snakes, and ladders.
- **View**: Handles the user interface and presentation, updating the display based on the game state.
- **Controller**: Manages user input and interactions, updating the model and view accordingly.
